# Phone-Book-Application DISCRIPTION.
As we all use cellphones. It is very hard for us to remember all the contacts of our colleagues. 
Therefore we save the contacts permanently for future use and sometimes we also delete some useless contacts. 
Suppose we are in hurry and want to call one of our friend then we directly search the contact by his full name or initials rather than scrolling down for searching that contact.
We usually want to see the contact list in ascending order as we can easily find the name with first English alphabet rather than searching it.
So, keeping in view all these things we have made a phonebook application which consists of several methods like 
inserting a contact, 
deleting
sorting
displaying
searching with initials 
Display 
Exit
We have made this possible by using different data structures like Binary search tree, Linked List, AVL Tree and Queue.
